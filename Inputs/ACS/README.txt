Data is downloaded from here: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0400000US17.140000&y=2018&tid=ACSST5Y2018.S1501&hidePreview=false

2018-2019 data is used because that is the most recent year that the ACS has census tract level data available. Census tract 
resolution is needed because the Chicago ridehailing data is at a census tract resolution. The 5-year estimate is used,
again because it is the only data file available at a census tract resolution. 2019 and 2020 months use the same data.

The data dictionaries are the metadata csv files in the folders.
